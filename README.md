# Rinobot-plugin

## Installation

`pip install rinobot_plugin`

## Getting started



## Development

Clone the repo and type:

`python setup.py develop`

This will install the package into a directory for development.

## Testing

We have basic tests working now for python2.7 and python3.5.

To run the tests in either interpreter just use

```python
python setup.py test
```

or, if python 3 is named `python3`


python3 setup.py test
```

If you have both 2.7 and 3.5 installed, you can use [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox) (install with `pip install tox`)
Then just type inside this repo.

```
tox
```
